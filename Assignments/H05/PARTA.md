# Part A: Conceptual Questions

## 1. Definition

**In your own words, what is abstraction in OOP?**

Abstraction is hiding complex details and exposing only essential features. It is focusing on what an object does rather than how it's done.

**Provide a short real-world analogy illustrating how abstraction hides unnecessary details.**

When driving a car you don't need to know how the engine works you just need to know about the gas, break, steering wheel, and gear shifter.

## 2. Abstraction vs. Encapsulation

**Briefly compare abstraction and encapsulation.**

Abstraction is hiding complex implementation details while encapsulation is protecting data.

**Why might someone confuse the two concepts?**

Because both involve a sort of hiding. 

## 3. Designing with Abstraction

**Imagine you are modeling a smart thermostat in a home automation system.**

**List three attributes and two methods you consider essential to the thermostat (from the user’s or system’s perspective).**

Three attributes that are needed would be battery life, temperature, and set temperature. Two methods that would be needed are move temp up and down.

**Explain why you would omit certain internal details (e.g., circuit design, firmware routines).**

You would omit internal details because no one cares how their A/C works they just want to use it.

## 4. Benefits of Abstraction

**Name two benefits of abstraction in large-scale software projects.**

It reduces complexity and enhances code reusability.

**In a short sentence, how can abstraction reduce code complexity?**

Abstraction reduces code complexity by hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities, allowing developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.
